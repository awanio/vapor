## Code guidelines
* Use /tmp folder if you need to create helper scripts such us python, bash, patch etc.
* Don't create any readme file to update the progress, just print it out
* If you need to create a backup file, put it on /tmp folder not in this working directory
* Use gofmt command to format every go code you've create or update
