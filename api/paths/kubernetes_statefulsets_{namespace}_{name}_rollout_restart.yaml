patch:
  summary: Restart StatefulSet pods
  description: |
    Trigger a rolling restart of all pods managed by a StatefulSet.
    
    This operation works by adding or updating a restart annotation 
    (`kubectl.kubernetes.io/restartedAt`) on the StatefulSet's pod template,
    which triggers Kubernetes to perform a rolling update with new pods.
    
    This is equivalent to running:
    ```bash
    kubectl rollout restart statefulset/{name} -n {namespace}
    ```
    
    **Note:** StatefulSets update pods in order, one at a time, respecting the 
    updateStrategy settings. Pods are updated in reverse ordinal order (from 
    highest to lowest) by default.
