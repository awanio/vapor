  summary: Set VM network interface link state
  description: |
    Change the link state of a virtual machine's network interface to disconnect (down) or reconnect (up).
    This is equivalent to the virsh commands:
    - `virsh domif-setlink <domain> <interface> down` - to disconnect
    - `virsh domif-setlink <domain> <interface> up` - to reconnect
    
    The interface can be identified by either:
    - Interface name (e.g., "vnet0", "vnet1")
    - MAC address (e.g., "52:54:00:12:34:56")
