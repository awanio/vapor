  summary: Restart deployment pods
  description: |
    Trigger a rolling restart of all pods managed by a deployment.
    
    This operation works by adding or updating a restart annotation 
    (`kubectl.kubernetes.io/restartedAt`) on the deployment's pod template,
    which triggers Kubernetes to perform a rolling update with new pods.
    
    This is equivalent to running:
    ```bash
    kubectl rollout restart deployment/{name} -n {namespace}
    ```
