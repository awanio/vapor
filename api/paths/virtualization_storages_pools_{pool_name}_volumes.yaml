  summary: Create a new volume in a storage pool
  description: |
    Creates a new storage volume within the specified storage pool.

    **Validation rules:**

    - `name` must be unique within the pool and use only letters, digits,
      hyphen (-) and underscore (_)
    - `capacity` is required and must be at least 1 MiB (1,048,576 bytes)
    - `format`, if provided, must be one of: `qcow2`, `raw`, `vmdk`, `qed`, `vdi`

    If the pool does not have enough free space, the request will fail with a
    validation error.
