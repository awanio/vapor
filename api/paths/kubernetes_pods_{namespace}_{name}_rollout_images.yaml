patch:
  summary: Update container images in a Pod
  description: |
    Update one or more container images in a Pod specification.
    
    **Important limitations:**
    - **Pods are immutable**: Once a Pod has started running, its container images cannot be changed
    - **This endpoint only works for Pods in Pending state** that haven't started yet
    - **Managed Pods**: If a Pod is managed by a controller (Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, etc.), 
      this operation will be rejected. You should update the controller instead.
    - **Manual Pods only**: This is primarily useful for standalone Pods not managed by any controller
    
    For running Pods, you must:
    1. Delete the existing Pod
    2. Create a new Pod with the updated images
    
    This is equivalent to running:
    ```bash
    kubectl set image pod/{name} container1=image1 container2=image2 -n {namespace}
    ```
    
    **Note:** Unlike workload resources (Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets), 
    Pods do not support rollout operations like restart or undo since they are 
    not managed by a controller and don't maintain revision history.

      Array of container name to image mappings.
      Each object in the array should have a single key-value pair where:
      - Key: container name (must exist in the Pod's regular containers, not init containers)
      - Value: new image to use (including tag)
      
      **Note:** This operation does not support updating init container images.
