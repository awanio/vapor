  summary: Get VM network interface link state
  description: |
    Retrieve the current link state of a virtual machine's network interface.
    This is equivalent to the virsh command:
    - `virsh domif-getlink <domain> <interface>` - to check link state
    
    The interface can be identified by either:
    - Interface name (e.g., "vnet0", "vnet1")
    - MAC address (e.g., "52:54:00:12:34:56")
    
    Returns "up" if the interface is connected or "down" if disconnected.
    If no explicit link state is set, the default is "up".
