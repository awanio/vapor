    Check what snapshot operations are supported for a VM based on its disk
    formats.


    This endpoint analyzes all disks attached to the VM and determines:

    - Whether internal snapshots are supported (requires all disks to be qcow2)

    - Whether external snapshots are supported (always supported)

    - Whether memory snapshots are supported (requires qcow2 for all disks)

    - Disk format limitations and recommendations
