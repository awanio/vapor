  summary: Attach PCI device to VM
  description: |
    Attach a PCI device to a virtual machine for passthrough.

    **Important Notes:**
    - VM must be powered off for initial PCI passthrough setup
    - All devices in the same IOMMU group must be passed through together
    - Device will be unbound from host driver and bound to vfio-pci
    - For GPUs, consider passing through audio device as well
