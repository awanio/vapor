## Slide 12: How AI Agents Excel
# Where AI Shines

**Perfect for AI:**
✅ CRUD operations
✅ API endpoint implementation
✅ Data transformation
✅ Test generation
✅ Documentation
✅ Error handling
✅ Boilerplate code

**Example: Complete CRUD in 30 seconds**
```go
// Prompt: "Create CRUD endpoints for VM management"
// Result: 500+ lines of production code
```

## Slide 13: Human Expertise Required
# Where Humans Are Essential

**Human-Only Decisions:**
❌ System architecture
❌ Security design
❌ Performance optimization
❌ API design
❌ User experience
❌ Business logic
❌ Production deployment

**The 80/20 Rule:**
- AI handles 80% volume (implementation)
- Humans handle 20% critical (design)

*[Visual: Human vs AI responsibility matrix]*

## Slide 14: The Architecture-First Approach
# Key Success Strategy

**1. Define Clear Boundaries**
```
internal/
├── docker/      # AI builds entire package
├── container/   # AI builds entire package
├── libvirt/     # AI builds entire package
└── common/      # Human defines interfaces
```

**2. Create Interfaces First**
```go
// Human defines interface
type RuntimeClient interface {
    ListContainers() ([]Container, error)
    GetContainer(id string) (*Container, error)
}
// AI implements interface
```

**3. Let AI Build Subsystems**
- Give AI complete context
- One subsystem at a time
- Clear acceptance criteria

*[Diagram: Architecture-first workflow]*

---

## Slide 15: Context Management Techniques
# Making AI Effective at Scale

**The Context Window Challenge:**
- Limited token windows
- Loss of context over time
- Inconsistent implementations

**Solutions That Work:**
1. **CLAUDE.md files** - Project context
2. **Clear package boundaries**
3. **Interface-driven design**
4. **Incremental development**
5. **Regular context refresh**

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md Example
## Project Overview
Vapor is a Linux management system...

## Architecture Philosophy
1. Clear separation of concerns
2. Interface-driven design
3. No code duplication
```

*[Visual: Context management strategy]*

## Slide 16: Prompt Engineering for Scale
# Effective AI Communication

**Prompt Template for Features:**
```
I need to add [FEATURE] to Vapor.

Context:

- Expected behavior: [SPECIFICATIONS]

Requirements:
1. Follow existing patterns in [PACKAGE]
2. Use common.SendError for errors
3. Add appropriate logging
4. Include unit tests

Generate the complete implementation.
```

**Results:**
