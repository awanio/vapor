# Indonesia Software Developer Conference 2025 - Call for Proposals

## Title
**Building Production-Ready Infrastructure Tools 10x Faster with AI Agents: The Vapor Story**

## Elevator Pitch
Discover how AI agents helped build Vapor, an open source comprehensive platfrom for managing modern Linux stacks, in just months instead of years. Learn practical strategies for leveraging AI to accelerate complex software development while maintaining enterprise-grade quality.

## Description

### What if you could build enterprise software 10x faster without sacrificing quality?

In this groundbreaking session, I'll reveal how AI agents transformed the development of **Vapor**, an open-source Linux OS management system that competes with decade-old established tools like Cockpit. What typically takes a team of developers years to build was accomplished in months through strategic AI-human collaboration.

### What You'll Learn

**The Reality of AI-Assisted Development at Scale**
- How we built a 100,000+ line codebase covering system management, container orchestration, Kubernetes integration, and virtualization
- Real metrics: From concept to production-ready in 3 months vs. traditional 2-3 year timeline
- The surprising truth about AI agents writing 80% of the code while maintaining enterprise quality

**Practical AI Agent Strategies That Actually Work**
- The "Architecture-First" approach: Why AI agents excel when given clear architectural boundaries
- Context management techniques that enabled AI to maintain consistency across a complex codebase
- How we achieved clean separation of concerns with AI generating entire subsystems (Docker, CRI, Libvirt integrations)

**Live Demonstrations**
- Watch AI agents implement complete features in real-time: from API endpoints to frontend components
- See how Vapor manages Docker containers, Kubernetes clusters, and KVM virtual machines - all built with AI assistance
- Experience the WebSocket-based terminal, real-time metrics, and Ansible automation features

**The Technical Deep Dive**
- Backend: Go with Gin framework, SQLite, JWT authentication, WebSocket support
- Frontend: TypeScript, Lit components, Tailwind CSS
- How AI agents handled complex integrations: Docker SDK, CRI, Libvirt, Kubernetes client-go
- Managing 20+ subsystems with consistent patterns across 500+ API endpoints

**Lessons from the Trenches**
- What AI agents do brilliantly (boilerplate, CRUD operations, API implementations)
- Where human expertise is irreplaceable (architecture decisions, security design, performance optimization)
- The productivity multiplier effect: How one developer with AI achieved team-level output
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

**The Business Impact**
- Cost reduction: 90% lower development costs compared to traditional approaches
- Speed to market: From idea to production in weeks, not years
- Quality metrics: How AI-generated code achieved similar defect rates to human-written code
- The democratization of complex software development

### Why This Matters

As Indonesia's tech industry rapidly grows, the ability to build sophisticated software quickly and efficiently becomes a competitive advantage. This talk isn't about replacing developers - it's about amplifying their capabilities to build things previously thought impossible for small teams or individual developers.

### Who Should Attend

- Software architects curious about AI's role in system design
- Developers wanting to 10x their productivity
- CTOs and technical leaders evaluating AI for their organizations
- Anyone interested in the future of software development

Come see how AI agents are not just writing simple scripts but building production-ready, enterprise-grade systems that serve real users. The future of software development is here, and it's more powerful than you imagined.

## Notes

### Technical Requirements
- **Presentation**: HDMI connection, internet access for live demos
- **Duration**: 45-minute session preferred (30-min talk + 15-min Q&A)
- **Demo Environment**: Will bring own laptop with local Vapor instance running

### Why I'm the Right Speaker

**Co-founder of Awanio**
- Awanio is a cloud platform to help organization to modernize thy're private infrastructure
- Awanio has successfully help private sectors, state own state owned enterprises and government agencies to transform they're legacy infra system into modern platform
**Proven Track Record with Vapor**
- Successfully built and deployed Vapor, a comprehensive Linux management platform comparable to Red Hat's Cockpit
- The entire project (~100,000 lines of code) was developed using AI agents (Claude) as primary development partners

**Unique Perspective**
- One of the few developers who has built a complete enterprise-grade system primarily with AI assistance
- Can demonstrate actual production code, not just proof-of-concepts
- Have documented the entire development process, including successes and failures

**Technical Depth**
- Deep understanding of both the AI tools and the underlying technologies (Go, Docker, Kubernetes, Linux systems)
- Can explain complex technical concepts in accessible ways
- Ready to share specific prompting strategies, context management techniques, and workflow optimizations

### What Makes This Talk Special

**It's Not Theoretical** - Everything I'll present is based on actual production code running in real environments. Attendees will see:
- Live Vapor instance managing Docker containers and VMs
- Actual code snippets generated by AI agents
- Real metrics and performance data

**Honest and Practical** - No hype, just facts:
- Where AI agents saved 10x time (CRUD operations, API endpoints, test generation)
- Where human intervention was critical (architecture, security, performance tuning)
- Actual challenges faced and how we solved them

**Actionable Takeaways** - Attendees will leave with:
- Specific prompt templates for complex software development
- Architecture patterns that work well with AI agents
- A framework for evaluating when to use AI vs. traditional development
- Access to Vapor's open-source code as a reference implementation

### Supporting Materials

- **Vapor Website**: https://vapor.awan.app/
- **GitHub Repository**: [github.com/awanio/vapor](https://github.com/awanio/vapor)
- **Live Demo Instance**: Available for committee review upon request
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides showing AI-assisted development process
- **Metrics Dashboard**: Real data on development velocity, code quality, and system performance

### Previous Speaking Experience
- Give a talk about Kubernetes
- give a talk about Docker in number of events
- PHP Indonesia Community
- Panada Conference
- Technical workshops on container orchestration and Linux systems
- Internal company presentations on AI-assisted development
- Contributing to open-source projects with documentation and tutorials

### Additional Context

Indonesia's software industry is at a crucial juncture where AI can be a massive accelerator for local innovation. By showing how a single developer can build enterprise-grade software that traditionally requires large teams, this talk can inspire a new generation of Indonesian developers to think bigger and build more ambitious projects.

The timing is perfect as many Indonesian companies are exploring AI adoption but lack concrete examples of successful implementations. Vapor serves as a powerful case study that's both technically impressive and practically applicable.
