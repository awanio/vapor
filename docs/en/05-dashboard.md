# Dashboard

## Overview

The Vapor Dashboard provides a comprehensive real-time view of your system's health and performance. It's the first screen you see after logging in and serves as your command center for system monitoring.

## Dashboard Layout

The dashboard is divided into several key sections:

### 1. System Overview Panel

Located in the top-left corner, this panel displays essential system information:

- **Hostname**: The name of your server
- **Operating System**: Linux distribution and version
- **Kernel**: Kernel version information
- **Uptime**: How long the system has been running
- **Architecture**: System architecture (e.g., x86_64, ARM64)

Example:
```
Hostname:        avid5
Operating System: linux
Kernel:          5.4.0-214-generic
Uptime:          101 days, 2 hours, 6 minutes
Architecture:    ubuntu
```

### 2. CPU Information Panel

The CPU panel provides detailed processor information:

- **Model**: Full processor name and specifications
- **Cores**: Number of CPU cores available
- **Load Average**: System load over 1, 5, and 15 minutes
- **Current Usage**: Real-time CPU utilization percentage

Example:
```
Model:         Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620 v4 @ 2.10GHz
Cores:         1
Load Average:  4.10, 3.53, 3.79
Current Usage: 10.2%
```

### 3. Memory Information Panel

Displays comprehensive memory statistics:

- **Total**: Total system memory
- **Used**: Currently used memory with percentage
- **Free**: Immediately available memory
- **Available**: Memory available for allocation without swapping

Example:
```
Total:     251.84 GB
Used:      53.04 GB (21.1%)
Free:      29.41 GB
Available: 197.2 GB
```

## Real-Time Metrics

### CPU Usage Graph

The CPU usage graph shows:
- **Real-time updates**: Updates every second via WebSocket
- **Historical data**: Last 5 minutes of CPU usage
- **Interactive**: Hover to see exact values
- **Color coding**: 
  - Green (0-50%): Normal usage
  - Yellow (50-80%): Moderate usage
  - Red (80-100%): High usage

### Memory Usage Graph

The memory usage graph displays:
- **Memory consumption**: Real-time memory usage
- **Trend analysis**: Visual representation of memory trends
- **Buffer/Cache**: Distinguishes between used and cached memory
- **Swap usage**: If swap is configured

## Interactive Features

### 1. Auto-Refresh

All metrics update automatically in real-time:
- System metrics: Every 1 second
- Graphs: Continuous streaming
- No manual refresh needed

### 2. Detailed Views

Click on any panel to access detailed information:
- **CPU Panel** ‚Üí Detailed CPU statistics and per-core usage
- **Memory Panel** ‚Üí Memory breakdown by type
- **System Panel** ‚Üí Full system information

### 3. Quick Actions

Available from the dashboard:
- **View Processes**: Quick link to process management
- **System Logs**: Jump to recent system logs
- **Network Status**: View network interfaces
- **Storage Overview**: Check disk usage

## Understanding the Metrics

### Load Average

The three load average numbers represent:
1. **1-minute average**: Immediate system load
2. **5-minute average**: Recent trend
3. **15-minute average**: Longer-term pattern

**Rule of thumb**: Load average should generally be less than the number of CPU cores.

### Memory Types

- **Used**: Active memory by applications
- **Free**: Completely unused memory
- **Available**: Memory that can be freed if needed
- **Buffers/Cache**: Memory used for performance optimization

### CPU States

The CPU usage includes:
- **User**: Time spent on user processes
- **System**: Time spent on kernel operations
- **Idle**: Time CPU is not being used
- **I/O Wait**: Time waiting for disk/network operations

## Dashboard Customization

### Theme Selection

Toggle between dark and light themes:
1. Click the theme icon (üåì) in the top bar
2. Dashboard adapts to your preference
3. Charts and graphs adjust colors automatically

### Language Support

Switch between English and Indonesian:
1. Click the language icon (üåê)
2. All labels and text update immediately
3. Number formats adjust to locale

## Performance Optimization

The dashboard is optimized for:
- **Low bandwidth**: Efficient WebSocket data transfer
- **High frequency updates**: Without overwhelming the browser
- **Large displays**: Scales from mobile to 4K screens
- **Multiple tabs**: Pauses updates when tab is not visible

## Troubleshooting Dashboard Issues

### Metrics Not Updating

If real-time metrics stop updating:
1. Check the connection indicator in the status bar
2. Verify WebSocket connection is active
3. Refresh the page if needed

### High Resource Usage

If the dashboard itself uses too much CPU:
1. Reduce update frequency in settings
2. Close unused dashboard tabs
3. Use light theme for better performance

### Data Accuracy

For the most accurate data:
- CPU metrics: Averaged over 1 second
- Memory metrics: Snapshot every second
- Load average: Kernel-reported values

## Mobile Experience

On mobile devices:
- Panels stack vertically
- Graphs resize automatically
- Touch gestures for graph interaction
- Simplified layout for smaller screens

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Speed up navigation with keyboard shortcuts:
- `R` - Refresh all metrics
- `D` - Toggle dark/light theme
- `F` - Toggle fullscreen
- `?` - Show keyboard shortcuts

## Export and Reports

From the dashboard, you can:
1. **Export metrics**: Download current data as CSV
2. **Generate reports**: Create PDF summaries
3. **Share snapshots**: Share dashboard state via link
4. **API access**: Get raw data via REST API

## Integration with Other Features

The dashboard integrates with:
- **Alerts**: Visual indicators for system alerts
- **Notifications**: Real-time problem notifications
- **Logs**: Quick access to related log entries
- **Terminal**: Open terminal for immediate action

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor regularly**: Check dashboard at least daily
2. **Set up alerts**: Configure thresholds for critical metrics
3. **Understand baselines**: Know your system's normal behavior
4. **React to trends**: Address issues before they become critical
